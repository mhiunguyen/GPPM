# Cleanup Report

Date: 2025-10-23

Purpose: Remove non-user-facing files, temporary artifacts, tests, and duplicated docs to make the repository leaner for end users while preserving all runnable services, core documentation, and setup guides.

frontend:

docs:
- PROGRESS.md (progress log)

## Items Preserved
- Core READMEs and INSTALLATION/QUICK_GUIDE/START_HERE
- Service code, Dockerfiles, requirements/pyproject files
- System-level docker-compose.yml and .gitignore
- Documentation under docs/ that is relevant to users (architecture and API docs)

## How to Restore (if needed)
If this repository is under Git, you can restore any file/folder from the last commit:

- Restore a specific file:
  git checkout -- <path/to/file>

- Restore a deleted folder:
  git checkout -- <path/to/folder>

- Undo the entire cleanup (reset your working tree):
  git checkout -- .

If those files were committed previously and you want to bring back the last committed version:
  git restore --source=HEAD~1 -- <path/to/file>

## Notes
- The root .gitignore already excludes common build artifacts (node_modules, dist, __pycache__), preventing re-adding heavy folders.
- If you still need any test suite or internal docs, we can re-add selected pieces from Git history or move them to a dedicated `docs/internal/` or `contrib/` area instead of the root.
